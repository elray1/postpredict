# Tests for postpredict.dependence.TimeDependencePostprocessor.apply_shuffle
#
# The test case is based on the example given in Fig 2 of
# Clark, Martyn, et al. "The Schaake shuffle: A method for reconstructing
# spaceâ€“time variability in forecasted precipitation and temperature fields."
# Journal of Hydrometeorology 5.1 (2004): 243-262.
#
# However, we swap the roles of geographical units and time, as we are modeling
# time dependence whereas that example is modeling spatial dependence.
